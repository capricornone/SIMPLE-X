    <!-- V1411 – FINANCIALS AUTO-COLLAPSE DELAY: On narrow screens, expanded Financials cards now stay open 20s before auto-collapsing (was 5s). -->

    <!-- V1393 – TARGET MARGIN FIX: Margin now applies to labour only, not whole job. 30% margin on labour = labour cost × 1.30 ÷ hours = sell rate -->
    <!-- V1392 – SCHEDULE LIST QUOTE HIDE: Tab counters (List/Calendar badges) now apply hideQuote filter; fixes counter mismatch -->
    <!-- V1392 – SCHEDULE LIST QUOTE HIDE: Added hideQuote check to second filter (hides Complete Quote if matching Work exists) -->
    <!-- V1391 – JOBS COUNTER FIX: Bottom nav Jobs badge now matches visible list filter (hides Quote visits when Work visit exists for same job) -->
    <!-- V1334 – JOB IDENTITY: stamp schedule.jobRef with QUO/INV and prefer QUO matching; display ref in schedule list -->
  <!-- V1333 – JOB REF: Prefer INV over QUO in Job List + treat jobs distinct by job reference -->
  <!-- V1332 – CALENDAR: Tap customer opens Customer status after Quote Visit complete; tooltip Tap to view -->
  <!-- V1331 – JOB LIST: Auto-default Active vs Historical on entry to Schedule List -->
  <!-- V1292 – NEXT ACTIONS: Hide completed work from queue if an invoice already exists (prevents duplicate invoicing) -->

  <!-- V1185 – HEADER: Removed logo from blue header -->
  <!-- V1184 – NEW SPLASH (ALL DEVICES): New logo on exact white, 6s auto-hide, tap-to-skip -->
  <!-- V1183 – REMOVED OLD SPLASH / TRANSITION SCREEN (APP OPENS STRAIGHT TO HOME) -->
  <!-- V1182 – SPLASH IS MOBILE-ONLY (DESKTOP SKIPS TRANSITION) -->

  <!-- V1109 – VAT-OFF HMRC FIX: HMRC VAT boxes now stay £0.00 when VAT is OFF; Financials "Materials VAT" display respects VAT ON/OFF; new line items default VAT rate to 0 when VAT is OFF -->
  <!-- V1110 – NET JOB PROFIT (After Costs): Financials card now shows 'NET JOB PROFIT (After Costs)' and correctly subtracts labour cost (robust numeric parse) -->
  <!-- V1089 – INVOICE FLOW: Awaiting Payment only after invoice emailed; add Job Complete step for invoice-first jobs -->
  <!-- V1078 – CUSTOMER LIST: Restore Trash icon (scope invoice-history delete-hide CSS so it doesn’t affect customer list) -->
  <!-- V1063 – INVOICE HISTORY: Paid collapsed card total now always shows correct amount (fallback calc) -->

    /* V658: INLINE CUSTOMER CREATION - QUOTE & INVOICE SECTIONS
     - Added "+ Create New Customer" to customer dropdowns in BOTH Quote and Invoice sections
     - Opens inline customer form right in current tab (blue border, blue background)
     - Same pattern as Schedule tab - no navigation away needed
     - Form fields: Name*, Address*, Town, Postcode*, Phone, Email
     - "Create & Select Customer" button creates customer and auto-selects it
     - Close button (✕) cancels inline form
     - Uses existing states: showInlineCustomerForm, inlineCustomerForm
     - Validation: Name, Address, Postcode required
     - Notification: "Customer created and selected!"
     - Customer immediately available in dropdown after creation
     - Quote/Invoice data preserved throughout (no navigation, no data loss)
     
     INVOICE SPECIFIC:
     - Preserves existing quote auto-fill logic (if accepted quote exists for customer)
     - Early return on CREATE_NEW prevents quote check from running
     - Emergency work scenario: Create customer → Create invoice → Done!
     
     BENEFIT:

    /* V657: BULK PDF - ADDED SUBTOTAL & VAT BREAKDOWN
     - SAVEPOINT: Fixed missing subtotal and VAT in All Invoices PDF export
     - Lines ~11476-11495: Added Labour, Subtotal, and VAT (%) to totals section
     
     WHAT WAS MISSING:
     - Old display: Materials → Additional Costs → Travel → Total
     - Missing: Labour cost, Subtotal, VAT breakdown
     
     NEW DISPLAY ORDER (Line ~11495):
     1. Labour: £XX.XX (hours × hourly rate)
     2. Materials Total: £XX.XX
     3. Additional Costs Total: £XX.XX
     4. Subtotal: £XX.XX (before VAT)
     5. VAT (20%): £XX.XX (if applicable)
     6. Travel / Mileage (non-VAT): £XX.XX (if applicable)
     7. Total: £XX.XX
     
     WHY THIS MATTERS:
     - HMRC compliance - need to show VAT breakdown
     - Customer clarity - can see what's taxable vs non-taxable
     - Professional invoicing standard
     
     CALCULATION:
     - Uses stored values from invoice object (inv.subtotal, inv.vatAmount, inv.vatRate)
     - These were calculated correctly when invoice was created
     - Only displays VAT line if vatAmount > 0 */

     - Scrolls to matching record after 300ms delay (allows DOM to update)
     - Prevents confusion when searching for customer that exists but is hidden by filter
     - Lines modified: ~8928-8973 (search onChange handler)
     - Example: Filter on "This Quarter", search "Smith", finds Smith from July, switches to All Time */

    /* V554: FILTER ACTIVE WARNING BANNER
     - CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURE: Prominent red warning banner when date filter is active
     - Banner appears between date filter panel and VAT summary
     - Shows: "DATE FILTER ACTIVE - SOME RECORDS ARE HIDDEN" with warning icon
     - Displays which filter is active (This Month/Quarter/Tax Year/Custom)
     - Instructs user to click "All Time" to see everything
     - Uses red background, 4px border, pulse animation for maximum visibility
     - Record count indicator: Shows "X of Y total records (Z hidden)"
     - Lines added: ~9048-9074 (warning banner), ~9357-9385 (record count)
     - Prevents accidental deletions, duplicates, and wrong HMRC submissions */

    /* V553: DATE FILTERING FOR FINANCIALS & VAT
     - FEATURE: Added date period filtering to Financials tab
     - Filter buttons: This Month, This Quarter, Tax Year, Custom Range, All Time
     - Filters affect: Total Revenue summary, HMRC VAT Summary, and invoice/quote records list
     - Tax Year = UK tax year (6 Apr - 5 Apr)
     - Quarter = Calendar quarters (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec)
     - Custom = User picks start/end dates
     - Lines added: ~779-782 (state), ~8929-9030 (filter UI), ~9213-9256 (date filter logic), ~9062-9107 (VAT filter)
     - HMRC compliance: Can now generate quarterly VAT returns and tax year summaries */

    /* V551: COLLAPSIBLE INVOICE RECORDS IN FINANCIALS
     - FEATURE: Invoice/quote records in Financials tab are now collapsible
     - Click header to collapse/expand each record (similar to HMRC VAT Summary)
     - When collapsed, shows: Customer name, record number, date, total amount

     - Warning text: "Only enable if you keep ALL fuel receipts"
     - Left-aligned and prominent (not hidden inside checkbox label)
     - Orange text (#text-orange-700) for visibility
     - Cleaner, more professional appearance */

    /* V526: FUEL VAT DEFAULT UNTICKED + RECEIPT WARNING
     - CRITICAL: Ensured claimFuelVatByDefault defaults to FALSE (unticked)
     - Added to migration code: Line ~337 - defaults to false for existing users
     - Added to default settings: Line ~368 - defaults to false for new users
     - 
     - ADDED FUEL RECEIPT WARNING:
     - Line ~9858: Added orange warning text below checkbox
     - "⚠️ Only enable if you keep ALL fuel receipts"
     - Makes it crystal clear this requires proper record-keeping
     - 
     - WHY THIS MATTERS:
     - Safe default - users won't accidentally claim without understanding
     - Opt-in only - only organized users with receipts will enable
     - Clear warning - prevents HMRC compliance issues
     - Reduces risk - most users (90%) never need to touch it
     -

    /* V525: FUEL VAT AUTO-CLAIM FULLY WIRED UP! 🚗
     - CRITICAL: The new "Auto-claim Fuel VAT" checkbox now ACTUALLY WORKS!
     - Setting: settings.claimFuelVatByDefault
     - Positioned next to "Vehicle & Mileage" heading (top right of section)
     - Only visible when VAT registered
     - 
     - HOW IT WORKS:
     - When TICKED: Fuel VAT automatically included in VAT calculations when mileage > 0
     - When UNTICKED: Fuel VAT NOT included (shows warning to enable in Settings)
     - 
     - CALCULATIONS UPDATED:
     - Quote form: Lines ~6659, 6685 - Conditional on claimFuelVatByDefault
     - Invoice form: Lines ~8094, 8120 - Conditional on claimFuelVatByDefault
     - Formula: milesDriven × (fuelRate ÷ 100 ÷ 6)
     - Example: 100 miles × (14p ÷ 100 ÷ 6) = £2.33
     - 
     - VEHICLE TYPE LINKAGE:
     - Fuel rate already linked to vehicle type (lines 9852-9864)
     - Diesel 1601-2000cc = 15p/mile → 2.5p/mile VAT
     - Petrol 1401-2000cc = 16p/mile → 2.67p/mile VAT
     - Electric = 9p/mile → 1.5p/mile VAT
     - Updates dynamically when vehicle type changes
     - 
     - STATUS DISPLAY:
     - Quote form: Shows ✅ ENABLED or ⚠️ DISABLED with rate
     - Invoice form: Shows ✅ INCLUDED or ⚠️ NOT INCLUDED inline

     - CRITICAL: VAT toggle switches now ACTUALLY WORK!
     - Quote toggle (line ~5740): Updates settings.vatRegistered on click
     - Invoice toggle (line ~7209): Updates settings.vatRegistered on click
     - Shows notification when toggled (ENABLED/DISABLED)
     - 
     - AUTO-CONVERSION ALREADY EXISTED (just needed toggle to work):
     - When VAT ENABLED: £1000 entered → auto-converts to £833.33 (exc. VAT at 20%)
     - When VAT DISABLED: £1000 entered → stays £1000 (no conversion)
     - Works on blur and Enter key
     - Applies to:
       * Quote Materials breakdown
       * Quote Additional Costs breakdown
       * Invoice Materials breakdown  
       * Invoice Additional Costs breakdown
     - 
     - Formula: net = gross / (1 + vatRate/100)

     - Default: 20% (UK standard rate)
     - Single percentage increments for flexibility
     - Helpful label: "20% (UK Standard)" to guide users
     - Updates settings.vatRate which is used throughout the app
     - Allows international users to set their local VAT rate */

    /* V518: REMOVED VAT CHECKBOX FROM SETTINGS
     - Removed the "VAT Registered?" checkbox from Settings page (lines 9581-9594)

     - Added visual toggle switch at top of Quote form (above quote number)
     - Added visual toggle switch at top of Invoice form (above invoice number)
     - Beautiful gradient background (blue for quotes, green for invoices)
     - Shows current state (ENABLED/DISABLED with color coding)
     - Smooth sliding animation
     - onClick currently just logs to console - NOT connected to VAT logic yet
     - Uses existing isVatRegistered variable to show current state
     - Ready to wire up in next version */

     - Removed materialsCost/additionalCost from ALL form definitions

     - Removed from CSV calculations and backup emails
     - Replaced with 0 in most calculation contexts

     - CRITICAL CHANGE: Removed all quick entry fields for Materials and Additional Costs
     - Now FORCES itemized breakdown only (no single-field entry)
     - Removed mutual exclusion logic (no longer needed)
     - Updated ALL calculations to ONLY use breakdown arrays:
       * Quote/Invoice Materials display
       * Quote/Invoice Additional Costs display
       * Quote/Invoice Subtotal calculations
       * Quote/Invoice VAT calculations (removed materialsCost/additionalCost checks)

     - CRITICAL: Fixed broken comment on line 6883 that commented out 'labour' variable
     - Symptom: ReferenceError "labour is not defined" when viewing saved quotes
     - Cause: Comment at end of line ate the next line's code
     - Fixed: Moved comment, proper variable declaration restored
     - Quote history now displays correctly after saving */

     - Fixed in both Quote and Invoice form VAT display calculations
     - Now checks breakdown OR quick entry field (same pattern as materials)
     - DISPLAY BUG FIX: Fuel VAT was calculated in total but not displayed as line item
     - Added "Fuel VAT (mileage): £X.XX" line to VAT Summary breakdown
     - SIMPLIFICATION: Removed "(VAT-able)" from all "Subtotal" labels */

    /* V510: HMRC Mileage Rates Advisory (VAT Users Only)
     - Added informational widget on Financials page for VAT registered users

     - Cars/Vans: 45p (first 10k), 25p (above 10k)
     - Motorcycles: 24p, Bicycles: 20p
     - Notes that Simple X uses 45p/mile standard rate
     - Helpful tax reference without requiring changes to existing system */

    /* V509: Mutual Exclusion - Quick Entry vs Itemized Breakdown
     - Added visual feedback: disabled fields are grayed out with opacity
     - Added helpful hints when fields/buttons are locked
     - Quick entry fields lock when itemized breakdown has entries
     - Add Item/Cost buttons lock when quick entry has values
     - User must clear one to use the other (mutual exclusion enforced)
     - Applied to: Quote materials, Quote additional, Invoice materials, Invoice additional
     - Resets properly when creating new quote/invoice */

     - BUG #3: Financials cards missing quick entry additional costs (line 9342)

     - Made "Use existing quote" button more prominent and obviously clickable
     - Changed from passive grey (bg-gray-100) to white with blue border
     - Added: 2px blue border, shadow, hover effects, blue text for quote number
     - Now clearly looks like an interactive button option */

     - Quote history cards missing quick entry additional costs (same as V502/V504 for invoices)

     - Total was correct but breakdown incomplete (missing £500 line item)
     - Now shows both quick entry AND itemized additional costs */

    /* V504: Fixed Invoice Email - Additional Costs Missing
     - Email generation was missing quick entry additional costs
     - Only included itemized breakdown, ignored single field additional cost

     - Same pattern as V502 - quick entry vs itemized breakdown */

    /* V503: CRITICAL - Fixed Invoice Form Live Total Display Bug
     - Invoice creation form was showing wrong totals (e.g. £137 instead of £1637)
     - Same copy-paste bug as V501: using quoteForm instead of invoiceForm
     - Fixed 5 instances in lines 7948, 7953, 7963, 7970, 7979
     - Live totals now calculate correctly as you type */

    /* V502: Fixed Invoice History Display - Additional Costs Not Showing
     - Invoice history cards were only displaying additional costs if itemized breakdown existed
     - Missed displaying quick entry additional costs (single field, not itemized)
     - Now displays both quick entry AND itemized additional costs
     - Total was correct, but the breakdown was incomplete */

    /* V501: CRITICAL - Fixed Invoice Total Calculation Bug
     - Invoice creation was using quoteForm instead of invoiceForm for materials/additional costs
     - This caused invoice totals to be wildly incorrect (e.g. £229 instead of £1,228.99)
     - Changed lines 2142-2155 to correctly use invoiceForm data
     - Invoice totals now calculate correctly: labour + materials + additional + mileage */

     - Non-VAT registered traders now get clean totals on invoices too */

    /* V499: Enter Key Navigation
     - Added Enter key to skip through form fields (opposed to clicking each box)
     - Works on Customer, Schedule, Quote, Invoice, and Settings forms

     - Excludes textareas (where Enter should create new line)
     - Excludes submit buttons (where Enter should submit form) */

     - All schedule creation now consistently defaults to 8am */

    /* V497: Quote VAT Display Fix + Force Reset Button Removal
     - Fixed quote page VAT display (only show when VAT registered AND enabled on quote)
     - Removed "Force Reset VAT Settings" button from Settings page
     - VAT registration checkbox remains - user can still toggle on/off
     - Default vatRegistered set to false (appropriate for small tradespeople under £90k) */

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to follow up on the quote I sent you ${c} days ago for ${n.description}.

Quote Reference: QUO${G(n.quoteNumber)}

Is there anything I can help clarify or assist you with regarding this quote? I'm happy to answer any questions you may have or adjust the quote if your requirements have changed.

Please feel free to reach out at any time.
